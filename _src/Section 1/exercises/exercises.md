## Section 1: Exercises


### Theory

1. Describe in your own words what is Jenkins and what it is used for. 

2. What do you need to have installed on your machine before installing Jenkins?

3. I recommended to install Jenkins LTS (Long Term Support). Why do you think I favour LTS over the latest Jenkins release? When would it be more appropriate to use the latest Jenkins release? If you are not familiar with the LTS concept, you can read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_support).

### Practice

Try to install Jenkins using another installation method. For example, if you are a MacOS/Linux user, try the installation on Windows (you don't even need a Windows machine, you can simulate it by using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) and [Windows Virtual Machine](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines)). Conversely, if you are a Windows 10 user, try to install Jenkins with Docker or via the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
