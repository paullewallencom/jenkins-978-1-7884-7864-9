## Section 1: Solutions to Exercises

### Theory

1. Jenkins is an open source tool to automate software development processes. It is often referred to as an automation server and is one of the most popular and used Continuous Integration (CI) server.

    Jenkins is used to automate software development processes like continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. This often involves:

	- running tests after an event (e.g. a code commit)
	- building software
	- packaging software
	- deploying software to a specific environment (e.g. development, testing, staging, or production)

2. Java 8.

3. Jenkins LTS (Long Term Support) provides more stability and this is particularly important if you are administering Jenkins for a software team. Jenkins LTS has a slower update cycle but it is supported over several months and receives security bug fixes. 

    The latest version of Jenkins may be more appropriate in case you want to use Jenkins' latest features that may not yet be present in the LTS release.
