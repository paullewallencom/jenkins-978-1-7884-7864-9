## Section 2: Exercises


### Theory

1. Describe the difference between a job/project and a build. 

2. What is a workspace?

3. What is a build trigger and how would you use it in a job?

4. What is a parameterized job and when would you use it?

### Practice

In video 2.4 you saw how to pull code from a GitHub repository. Instead of pulling code from this companion GitHub repository, open a GitHub account (if you don't have one already), create a new repository, and upload a shell or a batch script. Then configure a new Jenkins job to pull code from your repository and run the build. 

In case you are already familiar with build tools such as ant, maven, or gradle, write a script with these tools and invoke the relevant script when choosing the build step.
