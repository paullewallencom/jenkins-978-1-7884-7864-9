## Section 2: Solutions to Exercises

### Theory

1. A job or project is a runnable task such as running a script, compiling code, running tests, etc. A build is the result of a single execution of a job.

2. A workspace is a working directory where code, builds, and other temporary files are stored during a build.

3. A build trigger is a criteria or a condition for triggering a build. A build trigger can be used to run a job on a given schedule (e.g. once a day) or based on an event (e.g. every time code changes in a repository). 

4. A parameterized job is a job that takes a parameter from the user at run time. A parameterized job is used to pass the parameter to the underlying script executed by the job so that it can be customized and re-used.
